# E-business

Develop and create an E-business site for a local bed and breakfast, hotel, or other lodging venue in your community. The business can be real or fictional.  The website should include a company identity including a name, logo, and brand. The website should have elements of a typical lodging facility including contact information, the ability to make reservations, view different room types, view amenities, and local attractions.   Ensure that your E-business site includes:
	•	An e-commerce tool showing prices for different lodging types
	•	A scheduling tool allowing customers to book lodging
	•	An API to an online map service showing different local attractions
The E-business site does NOT need to be published; however, if you publish the website, you must obtain permissions in accordance with the competitive event guidelines and proper copyright law.
